\chapter{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Matrix factorizations/decompositions are computationally intensive linear algebra operations that are commonly used in problems like matrix inversion, solving linear systems etc. These factorizations therefore find application in numerous fields - any place where you would solve a system of linear equations. One of the most simple matrix decomposition is the LU factorization. The aim of this project is to implement and test three frameworks to see how they perform on the task. The frameworks used are the following: ``OpenMP", ``MPI", and ``CUDA".

\paragraph{}
In Chapter~\ref{matrix_decomposition} I will present the basic algorihm, and the different versions for each framework. In Chapter~\ref{results_computations} I will present the matrices used for the tests, and the time required for the algorithms. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{conclusions} I will give some final thoughts on the results.
